A hardware product made through STM32 and Circuitry components checking user's depression by monitoring user's sleep and movement behavior. The project is made by STM21F401RE.


Materials:

- PIR Motion Sensor: This component operates in the milliwatt range, with no significant energy storage.

- Breadboard
  
- 2 Red LED Light
  
-LCD Controller (HD47780): Used to display the central message


Installation Guide:

An image of the physical structure and the circuitry diagram is listed in this github. 
     
The configuration guide of the program are below:
     
    (1) Connect GPIO_PIN_9(A) and GPIO_PIN_7(A) and the GPIO_PIN_6(A) to the three red lights. 
      
    (2) Connect the PIR Motion Sensor to the GPIO_PIN_6 (B)
